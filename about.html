        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            As a computer science student at the University of California, San Diego, I have developed a strong foundation in the field and a passion for using technology to solve complex problems. Growing up in Houston, I was exposed to a diverse array of cultures and experiences, which has broadened my perspective and helped me become a well-rounded individual. I have a proven track record of being a great communicator, able to articulate complex ideas in a way that is easily understood by others. This skill has been valuable in both my personal and professional relationships, as it allows me to effectively collaborate with others to achieve common goals.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of my greatest strengths is my ability to take on leadership roles and guide a team towards success. I am a natural problem solver and enjoy working in fast-paced environments where I can put my skills to the test. Whether it's leading a team project in class or volunteering in my community, I am always looking for new challenges that allow me to make a positive impact.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am confident in my abilities and believe that I have the drive and determination necessary to achieve my goals. I am excited about the opportunities that lie ahead and am committed to using my skills and knowledge to drive positive change in the world of technology. Whether it's through my academic pursuits or by giving back to my community, I am always looking for ways to make a difference.
        </p>
